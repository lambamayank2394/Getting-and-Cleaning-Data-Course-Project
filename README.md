## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This is the repository as required by the Course Project instructions of Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course.

### Outline
This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at: The UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### Project in a nutshell
The R script, run_analysis.R is the key element of this submission. It is created as per the project instructions.
The following is a description of the project:

R script called run_analysis.R is created that does the following: 

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Additional Info.
Additional information about the variables, data and transformations can be found in the CodeBook.MD file.
